# Task1: Blink

**Objective:**

The objective of this task is to create an Arduino sketch that blinks an LED connected to pin 13 with a specific on-off interval. 

**Components Required:**

**Circuit**

Now that we know the components we can set up our Arduino as shown below.

**Task Description:**

You are responsible for developing an Arduino sketch (code) that accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Initialize an integer variable named `LEDpin` and assign the value 13 to it. This variable will represent the Arduino pin connected to the LED.

2. In the `setup()` method:
   - Set the `LEDpin` as an output pin using the `pinMode()` function.

3. In the `loop()` method:
   - Turn the LED on by setting the `LEDpin` to HIGH using the `digitalWrite()` function.
   - Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the `delay()` function.
   - Turn the LED off by setting the `LEDpin` to LOW.
   - Wait for another 1000 milliseconds.

4. The code in the `loop()` method should repeat the LED blinking process indefinitely.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Verify that the LED is correctly connected to pin 13 on the Arduino board with the necessary current-limiting resistor.
- Test the code on an Arduino board to verify that the LED blinks at the specified interval (1 second on, 1 second off).
